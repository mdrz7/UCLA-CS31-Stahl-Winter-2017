1. 
I had a lot of trouble figuring out the precision for the Barak case. The value comes out to be 26.175 but the required output was 26.18. Unfortunately, my output was constantly 26.17.
Though the homework doesn't really ask for a set amount of rounding in the answer, this was still bothering me. I figured that maybe having all my constants stored in doubles and being output in doubles may have been the cause for the error.
I also had a difficult time managing all my if-else-statements and all their respective code blocks given that all of it was condense.

2. 
The code is nearly identical for the Br-UberX and the Br-UberXL options and these cases can easily be switched between the two.

Normal (shakthi,13,13,Br-UberX)
Testing the minimum booking fee (shakthi,1,1,Br-UberX)
Testing the empty string for customer name (,12,12,Br-UberX)
Testing a nonpositive miles to be driven (shakthi,0,12,Br-UberX)
Testing a nonpositive minutes to be driven (shakthi,12,0,Br-UberX)
Testing an invalid ride type (shakthi,12,12,poop)
Testing a very large string for the customer name (shakthipoopshakthipoopshakthipoopshakthipoopshakthipoopcarrotcake,12,12,Br-UberX)
Testing numbers that exceed the capacity of a double (shakthi,99999999999999999999999999,0.000000000000000005,Br-UberX) Does not produce a correct output.
Testing noninteger miles to be driven (shakthi,poop,12,12) Does not produce a correct output.
Testing noninteger minutes to be driven (shakthi,12,poop,12) Does not produce a correct output.
